Building my first SQL data warehouse project
Hello This project marks the beginning of my journey into building a Data Warehouse from the ground up. The goal is to understand how raw data transforms into meaningful insights through structured design, ETL processes, and analytical modeling.

Iâ€™ll be implementing end-to-end workflows from data extraction and cleaning to warehouse design, loading strategies, and reporting.
